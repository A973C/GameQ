Information
===========
GameQ version 2 is based off of the original GameQ PHP program from http://gameq.sourceforge.net/.  That project was no longer being supported.

Note that this is very Alpha as I rewrite a lot of the code and bring the functionality into PHP 5.3

Requirements
============
* PHP 5.3+
	* Bzip2 - http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bzip2.php (A2S Compressed Responses)
	* Zlib - http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zlib.php (AA3 Compressed Responses)
