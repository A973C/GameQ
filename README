== Info ==
Copy of GameQ for Git. Done to allow submoduling of GameQ into other projects as I am sure you want. I make no claim to this product I am just hosting it on GitHub.

I will try to keep this repo updated as new games come out.  Feel free to leave messages with needed updates as well.

See example.php for how to.

For more information see http://gameq.sourceforge.net/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/gameq/
